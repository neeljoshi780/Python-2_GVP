(1).Find the Perfect numbers.
(A number is perfect if the sum of its
proper divisors equals itself.
E.g: 28 = 1+2+4+7+14)

number = int(input("Enter the number : "))
sum=0

for i in range(1,(number//2)+1):
    if(number % i == 0): 
        sum+=i
        
if(sum == number):
    print(number," Number is Perfact")
else:
    print(number," Number is not Perfact.!!")
